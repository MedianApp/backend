API For MedianApp

## What is Median
Median is an application that will allow people to specify their location, and find activities and things to do that are in between them.

## Want to contribute?
We will use waffle.io for the project management of the application.  It provides a nice interface that integrates with github issues. If you have acces to the waffle, the link is here https://waffle.io/MedianApp/backend.
